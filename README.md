# My-Memory-Game

## Overview

This is a matching memmory game. The goal is to flip over a card and match it with an unflipped one. When two cards are matched they remain in the flipped over possition. When all the cards are matched you win the game.

There is a move counter, star performance rating, a timer, and a reset button. Have fun!
